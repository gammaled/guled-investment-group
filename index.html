                        <p>The fundamental principle to our investment strategy is what is called <span class="emphasis">value investing</span>. Value investing focuses on investing in a quality company that you think is undervalued. We make this decision based on <span class="emphasis">strong fundamental analysis</span>.</p>

                        <p>Itâ€™s a <span class="emphasis">buy-and-hold</span> strategy. It pays attention to market overreactions to current events and companies that share their profits. This leaves some companies <span class="emphasis">undervalued</span> based on their long-term growth potential. We only invest in a company when its stock price is below its actual value.</p>
                        <p>We also look for a <span class="emphasis">margin of safety</span> before buying a stock. This means we look for a gap between what market value of a stock and potential value of stock as the company grows. We make sure that what can be gained is far more than potential loss.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-4">
                        <h3 class="subheading">"Don't put all your eggs in one basket"</h3>
                        <p>Ever hear of this saying? Well, it applies to <span class="emphasis">value investing</span>, too.</p>
                        
                        <p><span class="emphasis">Diversification</span> is a strategy that aims to reduce risk and maximize returns by allocating investment funds across different stocks, bonds and other investments. It helps an investor manage risk and reduce the volatility of an asset's price movements.</p>
                        <p>It addresses a type of risk that is diversifiable. This risk is specific to a company, industry, market, economy, or country. The most common sources of this risk: business risk and financial risk. Because it is diversifiable, investors can reduce their exposure through diversification. Thus, the aim is to invest in various assets so they will not all be affected the same way by <span class="emph">random market events.</span></p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-4">
                        <h3 class="subheading">Takeovers & Mergers</h3>
                        <p>Alongside our search for high quality stocks for the long term, we participate in risk arbitrage. It is an investment strategy used during <span class="emphasis">takeover deals</span> that enables us to profit from the difference in the market price of the target's stock and the acquirer's offer for the stock.</p>
                        <p>After the <span class="emphasis">acquiring company</span> announces its intention to buy the <span class="emphasis">target company</span>, the target company's stock price rises. When deal is announced, the target firm's stock price jumps toward the offer price by the acquirer. 
                        <p>We use this strategy to maximise our profits which we are holding and looking for more companies to invest in for the long term.</p>
